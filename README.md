# Here are what I need to work on for the app, after testing.


## Version 1.1

1. Pinned currently reading doesn't have image shown, just a play button.
2.  Library preferences need to be, group by author, folders, series. sort by recently played/added, a-z. filter by current, not startes, completed, all.
3.  collapsable options need to remember the state, user has choosen. some option changes reset all to uncollapsed. 
4.  you can collapse library, but not scroll through the library, if options are uncollapsed. scrollable is a must.
5.  folder name, for artist, author. root folder for author in some cases. filenames, folders for book names. and editing and persisting tags from library isn't properly working.
6.  clicking on a book shouln't make it as currently playing, unless it is played. pinned currently reading takes on whtever book is clicked on as playing. keep a order of clicked on and played ones below currently reading. pin it as started, below currently playing.
7.  include oled theme option for dark.
8.  don't show not started and started for every folder, artist. only show reading, if one is being read, or was. 
9.  add use grid layout to library preferences as a toggle, remove from settings.
